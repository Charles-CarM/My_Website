## Summary

My personal website used Gatsby JS for its optimal delivery of serving static webpages. The site introduces
who I am in the about me section, displays the portfolio of projects I have developed, and shows my technical 
skillset with languages and frameworks I am proficient in. Links to my contact information and social profiles
are provided throughout the page. By creating a Gatsby site It became apparent how efficient it is to develop
with it.
