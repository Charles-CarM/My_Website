I am a self-taught developer with a passion for building cool projects which
help me gain valuable experience. I make sure to hold myself accountable
for the times I have dedicated to programming in my schedule. I am 
currently learning React and will build some projects to add to my
portfolio. Learning how technologies work under the hood is intriguing
to me.

Some areas of interest to me are that I am a big sports fan, enjoy exercising, learning about Investing, and of course Programming. My favorite sports teams are the Phillies, Eagles, and Clippers. Weightlifting and running are a consistent part of my weekly routine. I enjoy learning about how to improve my wealth via purchasing productive assets. I am in the middle of my coding journey and trusting the process of applying the concepts I've learned to lead me further along.
